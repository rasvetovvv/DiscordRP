## Client ID
* Go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application, the name of the application will be the title that shows up on your profile.
* Copy the Application ID and put it in the Client ID Box of DiscordRP.

## Adding Images
* Go to the `Rich Presence` tab in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
* Add an image that is atleast 512x512, Discord doesn't allow lower resolution images.
* DiscordRP updates the image list every minute, Discord usually takes around a minute or 2 to process the it. After a couple minutes it *should* show up inside `Key` box in DiscordRP. If it doesn't, exit DiscordRP from the System Tray and restart it.
